In our project, we created a tool which analyzes Holocaust survivors' testimonies and presents all locations mentioned in their story on a map.

First, we acquired Klara Figa's audio-visual testimony, filmed by the <a href="https://sfi.usc.edu/">USC Shoah foundation</a> in 1996.
Next, we transcribed the testimony and created an xml file using oxygen, which also allowed us to tag all location mentioned using TEI tags.

In building our new tool, we wrote a Python program which receives an xml testimony file (does not necessarily receive the file we tagged, it can work on any xml testimony file with tagged locations as 'placeName').
The code parses the xml file, retrieves all locations and builds an html website.
The website contains a google map (using google API) which marks all found locations.
Clicking on each marker opens an info-window which contains all references to that place made by the testimony giver.
In the next tab, the entire testimony will be presented.

Our goal was to explore the journey of the Holzman family, to learn about their story during WWII and create something to commemorate it.

In general, creating this tool enables us to present a family's journey through an interactive map. 
We can see places which are mentioned more than others, and also it can allow people searching for specific locations to do so with ease.
