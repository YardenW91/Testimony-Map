And very young age I started to do things to see what my older sisters are doing and I learned to knit to sew to embroidery. I wasn't the social, I am now too not too much social life but I learn now. Since I go places and I drive, I got my license so it is great to be because from everybody will learn, and I can talk English and communicate, because I can read now. I couldn't read, I didn't went to school, I didn't know nobody in <a href=#A34>Portland</a> when we came.<br /><br />Klara Figa: I knew <a href=#A309>Portland, Maine</a>, and once, I like sardines they serve, I opened up a can and I said Oh I know where we going, they make there fish!Sardines, and I loved them.<br /><br />Klara Figa: <a href=#A311>Portland</a> picked us because my husband had a profession, a designer, he had a course taken special from the German because he was working all the time, and he made beautiful things with other people, shoe makers. He designed and he sold the stitching.<br /><br />Klara Figa: When I was living here in <a href=#A322>Portland</a> I got letters from <a href=#A323>Israel</a>. Yeah, I was in contact with my sister, with my other sister, but she probably died shortly. And she was the oldest from the... my father's, I wasn't close because I was too young and she was married with children already.<br /><br />Rachel: I think that, umm, I'm very proud of my mother and my father for the positive attitude and energy they brought to starting a life here in <a href=#A370>Maine</a>, In <a href=#A371>Portland</a> after the war that umm, 6 children, and my father developed his own business and I think the energy to survive and to prosper and to nurture us and to create a life was amazing given where they come from and what they'd done to survive, and they really were role models for us, for all the 6 children, for working hard, accomplishing, taking responsibility for our lives. I think they're very strong in that area, because we are all very independent, everybody has an established career and everyone works hard. Just 5. Plus there's a very positive energy around family and children that we all have, and umm... and uh, I know for myself I feel a very strong Jewish Identity and I now live in a very Jewish community in <a href=#A372>Sharon, Massachusetts</a>, and I think my choice of my husband and our family, where we live, what we do is very much a reflection of my, of the values my parents gave to me.

You have to work, you have to make a name and you have to do what you are able, and god gave me a... a... I don't know what, a gift, that I could knit. There was so cold, and I made them shawles, and I made them dreses for children, naked. I did so much without the machine. My hand was a machine. I brought for my mother, my sister, she was sick. Well, a family can only survive when they are together. I wouldn't be here with my family, but they come and help me, I wouldn't be able to survive alone. I'm not alone, I don't feel I am alone.

That's all that is left alive, is my sister and my sister-in-law who married to Shulim.<br /><br />Klara Figa: We were preparing for <a href=#A39>Israel</a>, and that's why my friends left in 1939 before the war came out. They left for <a href=#A40>Israel</a>, one by one. There were 8 or 6, their parents were there already. And she said there when you go, you have to sew, and learn to sew is very important. So when I knit a sweater and sent to <a href=#A41>Israel</a> to a cousin, that letter what she wrote to me, she said you don't have to be afraid you will make a living. I made a ? for a baby, I still have it.<br /><br />Klara Figa: Yo see? I'll tell you a story, this is a miracle. Our family, my sister that is in <a href=#A64>Israel</a>, she had non-Jewish friends, a lot of them. She was very close. So her friend was living next door and we had a big cellar with closets from bricks for wine, my mother used to make her own, it was the place to protect from bombing, and they bombed near us maybe 5 yards away. Was the cemetery, a non-Jewish. And she, that lady was pregnant and she was newlywed, and she was in our cellar friend to my sister, her husband came down the cellar too, and he was from German descent, he talked German. After the fire and all those things stopped, he went out to look around because he felt he's German, he's one of them. But really he was our friend, because his wife was in our cellar and good friends with my sister. And they asked, Is there any Jews around here?, he said No.<br /><br />Klara Figa: Because it's a holy land. Holy land, just like in <a href=#A121>Israel</a>. And he wants to die there, so he choose with his wife and his children, and we went with the children too, my father, my mother we all went. But we haven't got any money, so my... No, my father passed away there. 6...<br /><br />Klara Figa: In that... In that <a href=#A123>Sukholozhsk</a>. So she was there, my brother told me, my sister-in-law, when I was in <a href=#A124>Israel</a>, she said I went to see your father in the hospital before he died. She didn't told me nothing. They brought him on a horse in bag, without notifying that he was sick, that he's dying, that he died. I didn't know.<br /><br />Klara Figa: He heard how terrible it was, he didn't want to tell me or the children to know about his life, his family life. They told him the tales, probably, he didn't told me. And he didn't want anybody to know. From the kids, nobody knew who they are 'till my daughter find out when she went to <a href=#A208>Israel</a>, before me, she went to <a href=#A209>Israel</a> when she was 16 because she knew I have a sister, a brother and he was alive. They had a farm, they sold property, the lands that my father had. Some of it, there is still left enough, but they knew what to do. They bought a farm just like what he knew about. A milk farm they had, in <a href=#A210>Rehovot</a>. It was a Moshav.<br /><br />Klara Figa: To <a href=#A255>Israel</a>. To meet with my family. This was mine dream.<br /><br />Klara Figa: Those who are planning and waiting for to go to <a href=#A274>America</a>, to go to <a href=#A275>Israel</a>, to go to other countries, <a href=#A276>Australia</a>, I don't know.<br /><br />Klara Figa: When I was living here in <a href=#A322>Portland</a> I got letters from <a href=#A323>Israel</a>. Yeah, I was in contact with my sister, with my other sister, but she probably died shortly. And she was the oldest from the... my father's, I wasn't close because I was too young and she was married with children already.<br /><br />Klara Figa: My oldest, my oldest wanted to know, everybody has a cousin, a grandma, a grandfather... This was painful. She was suffering, and she went when she earned her first job, she went to <a href=#A330>Israel</a> to my sister and to my brother.<br /><br />Klara Figa: And she get to know them. She didn't find, they were just like me, she settled and worked hard in <a href=#A331>Israel</a>. I worked here, to gain what I wanted, a home.<br /><br />Klara Figa: Hayloft. And that cousin, when she was 16,  my oldest, the Rabbi's guy, I told him I'm very lonely I want to go to <a href=#A333>Israel</a>, I don't feel here, I have nobody. He said, I have somebody, he said that he going to <a href=#A334>New Jersey</a> to <a href=#A335>Newark</a>, and I said <a href=#A336>Newark</a>? I have a cousin! and he said, Who is your cousin?, I said Moishe Malz. He said, He's the president from my father's schul, he's a Rabbi. Rabbi's guy, I saw him yesterday in the temple, but he went out, I couldn't talk to him to remind him what he've done for me. He bought a new station wagon, he had 2 children, his wife was pregnant, I didn't know about it, and he... Pearl and me, and I left my husband with all the children, 5, and her I gave a good time at 16. Sweet 16, everybody talked I never did nothing, but I can do something. This was the best reunion that she found out now. And she remembers it, she went to them to weddings, to... And I got to know, her husband was there, with the children and the 2, we were all together on simches. And they went to <a href=#A337>Israel</a>.

After the fire and all those things stopped, he went out to look around because he felt he's German, he's one of them.

We couldn't get this because we didn't belong to <h id="A73">Lvov</h> we were from <h id="A74">Krystynopol</h>, refugees.

He was very good in mechanical things. So he went to school, and he wasn't home Friday night when they took us all. So that brother had bad luck, because he was mama's boy and he was never away. He was maybe 19 or 20. We went, when they took us after a year, I didn't even took the report card, but my sister took it out and he send it over which was the best in <h id="A82">Lvov</h>. One year only, and I catched up with all of them, because I knew Jewish it was a Jewish school all girls and the children didn't know Jewish so it was for them hard to learn the beginning. For me it was easy because I learned when I was very young to ? and to write letters Jewish, I did."<br /><br />                        Interviewer: "Did you feel safe in Lvov?"<br /><br />                        Klara Figa: "Oh yeah, my mother's brother, my mother's sister they all were in <h id="A86">Lvov</h>.

They took in their mother in a hiding place, and they found a woman who worked for them, who did a farm to... to that not to notice that they are hiding in a... in a haylot or a, how they call it?"<br /><br />                        Interviewer: "Hayloft."<br /><br />                        Klara Figa: "Hayloft. And that cousin, when she was 16,  my oldest, the Rabbi's guy, I told him I'm very lonely I want to go to <h id="A333">Israel</h>, I don't feel here, I have nobody. He said, "I have somebody", he said that he going to <h id="A334">New Jersey</h> to <h id="A335">Newark</h>, and I said "<h id="A336">Newark</h>? I have a cousin!" and he said, "Who is your cousin?", I said Moishe Malz. He said, "He's the president from my father's schul, he's a Rabbi". Rabbi's guy, I saw him yesterday in the temple, but he went out, I couldn't talk to him to remind him what he've done for me. He bought a new station wagon, he had 2 children, his wife was pregnant, I didn't know about it, and he... Pearl and me, and I left my husband with all the children, 5, and her I gave a good time at 16. Sweet 16, everybody talked I never did nothing, but I can do something. This was the best reunion that she found out now. And she remembers it, she went to them to weddings, to... And I got to know, her husband was there, with the children and the 2, we were all together on simches. And they went to <h id="A337">Israel</h>. One daughter is a reporter, and she is in <h id="A338">Jerusalem</h>, have 3 children."<br /><br />                        Interviewer: "So as the years passed by, the rest of your family, your other children, didn't talk to you much about your Europe experience?"<br /><br />                        Klara Figa: "They didn't even know what's going on, it was..."<br /><br />                        Interviewer: "You didn't tell them?"<br /><br />                        Klara Figa: "No. My husband says (puts finger on mouth to show silence) "Keep your mouth shut, don't talk to the children nothing". I didn't know why the reason."<br /><br />                        Interviewer: "Do they know now?"<br /><br />                        Klara Figa: "She knows, and my youngest read that book and cried. It's a terrible effect, so many years they grew up, and they didn't know the difference what life, what is cousins, what is family. It's not family to have each other, you have to have the roots, you have to know where you came from, where you belong."<br /><br />                        Interviewer: "Now that 50 years have passed since the Shoah, how do you think your experiences affected your life that followed?"<br /><br />                        Klara Figa: "My life wasn't sweet, but I survived only because I take everything what my mother blessed me, and the blessing is she send me my husbad, who takes care of me, and my father bought me shoes which my husband notice I wear and he siad, "Do you know, I made them in 1937!". Miracles happen to me. You know why? I believe in God, and I believe that god leads me. And all those miracles happen with a cost, my father, my mother, I was good to both. I was a child, and I'm still a child. And that's why I live happy. Children are happy, because you learn every day something else 'till you die, 'till the last day of your life. And if you don't learn, you are dead. We have to, and I'm very quick to learn. My mind, thank God, I had blessings from my mother every time I give to her, I cook for her, so she had somebody to live for, but she couldn't because my brother, I knew now what hurt her. That cousin wrote a letter about how it happened, it was terrible to describe about, but it's supposed to be like that. We cannot prevent things that happen."<br /><br />                        Klara Figa: "Here to the right is mine daughter Rachel, my grandson Benjamin and my son-in-law, David. I'm very proud to have them today with me."<br /><br />                        Interviewer: "Is there anything that you would like to tell your mother, ot your grandmother? About her experiences?"<br /><br />                        Benjamin: "No."<br /><br />                        Rachel: "I think that, umm, I'm very proud of my mother and my father for the positive attitude and energy they brought to starting a life here in <h id="A370">Maine</h>, In <h id="A371">Portland</h> after the war that umm, 6 children, and my father developed his own business and I think the energy to survive and to prosper and to nurture us and to create a life was amazing given where they come from and what they'd done to survive, and they really were role models for us, for all the 6 children, for working hard, accomplishing, taking responsibility for our lives. I think they're very strong in that area, because we are all very independent, everybody has an established career and everyone works hard. Just 5. Plus there's a very positive energy around family and children that we all have, and umm... and uh, I know for myself I feel a very strong Jewish Identity and I now live in a very Jewish community in <h id="A372">Sharon, Massachusetts</h>, and I think my choice of my husband and our family, where we live, what we do is very much a reflection of my, of the values my parents gave to me. And umm, thank you 'Ma."<br /><br />                        Klara Figa: "Thank you honey, for coming to <h id="A379">Portland</h>, the first citizen, before I was."<br /><br />                        Interviewer: "On behalf of the Shoah foundation, I'd like to thank you and express our appreciation for letting us come into your home and sharing the stories of your life and of your family with us. Thank you very, very much."<br /><br />                        Klara Figa: "It's my pleasure, and so my family enjoy having you here. They came down the middle of the night and they 'gonna be happier after they can hear more about this."<br /><br />                        Interviewer: "Thank you very much."<br /><br />               </p>

  <h2 style="font-family:verdana;"><center>About the project</center></h2>
  <p>In our project, we created a tool which analyzes Holocaust survivors' testimonies and presents all locations mentioned in their story on a map.<br /><br />First, we acquired Klara Figa's audio-visual testimony, filmed by the <a href="https://sfi.usc.edu/">USC Shoah foundation</a> in 1996.<br />Next, we transcribed the testimony and created an xml file using oxygen, which also allowed us to tag all location mentioned using TEI tags.<br /><br />In building our new tool, we wrote a Python program which receives an xml testimony file (does not necessarily receive the file we tagged, it can work on any xml testimony file with tagged locations as 'placeName').<br />The code parses the xml file, retrieves all locations and builds an html website.<br />The website contains a google map (using google API) which marks all found locations.<br />Clicking on each marker opens an info-window which contains all references to that place made by the testimony giver.<br />In the next tab, the entire testimony will be presented.<br /><br />Our goal was to explore the journey of the Holzman family, to learn about their story during WWII and create something to commemorate it.<br /><br />In general, creating this tool enables us to present a family's journey through an interactive map. <br />We can see places which are mentioned more than others, and also it can allow people searching for specific locations to do so with ease.<br /><br />Download our data <a href=http://www.filedropper.com/klarafigatestimony>here</a></p>
